# time: O(n) 
# Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop, 
# closer inspection reveals it to be linear. 
# Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence 
# (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), 
# the while loop can only run for nn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. 
# This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, 
# the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time. 
# All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.

# space: O(n)
